      <h2>Our Focus</h2>
      <p>Black Student Insight serves as a platform for current Black college students
        to share their experiences and beliefs regarding their campuses, while also
        providing prospective students with general information about the schools,
        such as overall student diversity demographics, admissions statistics, and
        tuition for their university of interest.

      <h2>Our Reasoning</h2>
      <p> The college application process is one of the most stressful
        periods during a teen’s academic career.  Amongst difficult
        course work, standardized testing, multiple questions probing
        into their qualifications and life story, high schoolers are
        constantly being reminded that the decisions made during this
        time will determine the course of the rest of their lives.
        Consequently, the pressure to find the “perfect college” drives
        students to scour the internet searching for videos, articles,
        and reviews that could provide any insight into what their life
        would look like on a particular campus. Sites like Niche.com or
        StudentReviews.com offer students this by allowing students that
        actually attend the school to rate and review their experiences.
      </p>
      <p>As once prospective high school applicants and now college
        students, one thing the creators noticed is that it is very difficult for
        minority students to find insightful information about the cultural
        communities on these websites. Especially in predominantly white
        institutions, the minority communities often make up just a small
        percentage of the school. Despite being a fraction of the overall
        population, they often have very strong, active communities to the
        point that the experience of a minority student will be vastly
        different than that of their white counterparts. Because these
        communities only make up a small percentage of the school, these
        experiences are not highly visible on these college rating sites.
        The sentiments expressed on these websites do not necessarily provide
        minority prospective students that foresight into what their own
        lives will be like.
