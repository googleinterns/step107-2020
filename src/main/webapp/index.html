      <h2>Our Focus</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Black Student Insight serves as a platform for current minority students 
          to share their experiences and beliefs regarding their campuses, but also 
          allows prospective students to look at diversity breakdowns, as well as
          average admissions statistics for their university of interest.

      <h2>Our Reasoning</h2>
      <br>
      <p> The college application process is one of the most stressful
          periods during a teen’s academic career.  Amongst difficult 
          course work, standardized testing, multiple questions probing
          into their qualifications and life story, high schoolers are
          constantly being reminded that the decisions made during this
          time will determine the course of the rest of their lives.
          Consequently, the pressure to find the “perfect college” drives
          students to scour the internet searching for videos, articles,
          and reviews that could provide any insight into what their life
          would look like on a particular campus. Sites like Niche.com or
          StudentReviews.com offer students this by allowing students that
          actually attend the school to rate and review their experiences. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>As once prospective high school applicants and now college
          students, one thing the creators noticed is that it is very difficult for
          minority students to find insightful information about the cultural
          communities on these websites. Especially in predominantly white
          institutions, the minority communities often make up just a small
          percentage of the school. Despite being a fraction of the overall
          population, they often have very strong, active communities to the
          point that the experience of a minority student will be vastly
          different than that of their white counterparts. Because these
          communities only make up a small percentage of the school, these
          experiences are not highly visible on these college rating sites.
          The sentiments expressed on these websites do not necessarily provide
          minority prospective students that foresight into what their own
          lives will be like.
